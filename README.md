Automated solution for farming based on an android app connected to sensors to automate tasks such as irrigation, fertilization etc.
Arduino provides data to thingspeak server, which is called via its API in the FarmConnect App
Steps to Use:

  1.Provide wifi and password in SmartIrrigationSystem.cpp
  
  2. Open FarmConnect App, login and view details!

NOTE : Arduino Module has dummy values right now due to lack of WiFi module. The mobile app and server are functional with dummy values.
